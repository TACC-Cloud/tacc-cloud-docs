TACC Cloud APIs and Resources
=============================

The Cloud and Interactive Computing Group has been expanding the capabilities of its Science-as-a-service API platform,
including new support for streaming/sensor data and a Version 3 of the primary APIs. We refer to this new effort as
the Tapis Platform. More information on Project Tapis coming soon!

The TACC Cloud APIs include Tapis (Agave) API, offering Science-as-a-Service; the Abaco API utilizes reactors, which are
functions-as-a-service adapted to the HPC use case; and TAS, the TACC Allocation System which handles identity and
allocations.
